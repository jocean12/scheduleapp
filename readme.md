# ScheduleApp
#
This app is designed to help a large printing company schedule their printers.  Project managers can add jobs then someone can go in and schedule the jobs for the printers.
#
This is built on Wordpress and uses custom PHP which allows users from the font end to add posts and then someone can schedule the jobs.  The schedule section uses jQuery droppable commands and a date/time picker.  It also uses AJAX calls to update the database.  
#
The theme is a custom Bootstrap Wordpress theme.
